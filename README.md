# ML Pipeline Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates a complete ML pipeline, from data preparation to deployment. To do this, we'll use the Iris dataset (classification task) from Scikit-Learn library.

## Features
- Data Cleaning and exploratory analysis
- Model Training and Evaluation
- Deployment via Flask API

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Perform the EDA: Use the file: `eda.ipynb`.
3. Prepare the data: `python src/data_prep.py`.
4. Train the model: `python src/train_model.py`.
5. Deploy with Streamlit: `streamlit run src/deploy_app.py`.
